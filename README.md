In this Python code, I did an extensive analysis of cancer treatment on mouse using pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats libraries. The dataset consisted of mouse metadata and study results, which were merged into a single DataFrame. Duplicate pairs of Mouse ID and Timepoint were identified and removed. Subsequently, summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for tumor volume were found given drug regimen using both groupby and aggregation methods. Bar plots illustrating the total number of observed mouse timepoints for each drug regimen were generated using both Pandas and pyplot.

Pie charts were employed to visualize the distribution of female versus male mice, utilizing both Pandas plot and pyplot. The final tumor volumes for specific treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) were analyzed using distribution stats. The code used for loops and conditional statements to identify potential outliers (from quantiles, using IQR) and plotted with a boxplot. With line and scatter plots, I plotted a single mouse's tumor volume over time with Capomulin treatment and a scatter plot depicting the correlation and linear regression between mouse weight and average tumor volume.

Analysis (in notebook, too):

1. Tumor Volume Distribution Across Treatments:
   The box plot representing the distribution of final tumor volumes across different treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) reveals that Capomulin and Ramicane exhibit lower median final tumor volumes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. This suggests that Capomulin and Ramicane treatments may be more effective in reducing tumor sizes, as indicated by their lower median values.

2. Capomulin On A Single Mouse:
   The lineplot for tumor volume over time for a mouse on capomulin suggests a significant impact, in that, Capomulin is rather effective on tumors. This would, however, require observation of more mice under the same treatment assuming all other factors are controlled.  

3. Correlation Between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume in Capomulin Treatment:
   The scatter plot with a superimposed linear regression line illustrates a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume within the Capomulin treatment regimen. The calculated correlation coefficient of the regression model reinforces this positive relationship. This implies that, on average, mice with higher weights tend to have larger tumor volumes when undergoing Capomulin treatment.
